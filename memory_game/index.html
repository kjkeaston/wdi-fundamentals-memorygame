		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

	<h2>Why play?</h2>

	<p> Why play? More like why not!? Play the game because games are fun! Life is too short to be all work and no play. This game will challenge you mentally and emotionally, it is not for the faint of heart. Only step up to the plate if you can handle the heat. Be prepared to face certain doom as you try, and likely fail, to memorize the location of each card. Only the truly gifted players will have what it takes to beat this behemoth of a game. 
		<br>Good luck.
